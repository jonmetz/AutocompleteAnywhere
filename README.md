AutocompleteAnywhere
====================
Download the addon [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/autocompleteanywhere/).

When the AutocompleteAnywhere icon is pressed, all forms on the page will be searched for elements 'username' and 
'password'. If these form elements are present and autocomplete has been set to equal "off", it will be set 
equal to "on", allowing a user to instruct Firefox to remember his or her password.

The addon has a few usability issues that should be fixed, most importantly, there is no visibile feedback when the user 
presses the icon, so he or she has no idea if autocomplete has been turned on, see TODO for more wanted features.
